			<h3 id="summary">SUMMARY</h3>
			<p>Concept Sketch Development is designed to allow students to solve creative problems each week, but not necessarily take every idea to its final product. This course teaches quick and agile thinking.</p>

			<h3 id="descr" >DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>The objective of this course is to focus on concept development and creative problem solving, presenting ideas in sketch form rather than fully realized pieces/products. Each week new ideas will be presented to the group as if a client were looking for a designer to take on a particular project.</p>

			<h3 id="methods" >COURSE METHODS</h3>
			<p>Our work in this course will be accomplished through: demonstrations, in-class studio work, lectures, image and video presentations, one-on-one instruction, group discussions/critiques, online tutorials, research and out-of-class homework. Participation is crucial to achieve the learning objectives.</p>
		
			<p>Our work in this course will be accomplished through: demonstrations, in-class studio work, lectures, image and video presentations, one-on- one instruction, group discussions/critiques, online tutorials, research and out-of-class homework. Participation is crucial to achieve the learning objectives. It is equally crucial that you strive to maintain an open mind and make the most of each project. If you have had similar projects in the past – it is your responsibility to add levels of complication to make each project challenging and rewarding. Please ask me for ideas if you want to add complexity to a project. If there is insufficient time in class, please arrange to work with me one-on-one during office hours.
			</p>

			<p>There is no textbook required for this course. For the purpose of discussion and for research, students will be required to read materials and watch tutorials given in class, via books provided in class, readings stored in the Blueline classroom, and via websites. We will have a test at Mid-term and a final project. I will routinely give online links and bring books and magazines to class for you to either read or browse for specific project research or general research on graphics, design and/or illustration trends. Written responses will be required to some readings, images, design and videos.

		<section class="content">
			<h3 id="extrastuff" >EXTRA STUFF</h3>
			<p>Attendance and punctuality are mandatory. This is more true in this class than possibly any of my other graphics classes. This is because the dialog that happens in class is one of the most important things we will be doing. At times we will address assignments as a group. At other times you will be working on your own. However, I expect students to be bouncing ideas off each other, as well as me, every class. Designers often work in an isolated world, but this is not always true. Designers are just as often dealing with clients and feedback from both clients and colleagues. We teach plenty of classes where students are working alone. This will be one of your chances to work creatively in a group and I will want you to do it as often as possible.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, as with all our other classes, I expect you to behave as professionals over the course of the semester, and that includes showing up to class on time. Excused absences include athletic participation for varsity athletes, some emergencies, and documented illness.</p> 
			<p id="white">Regardless of whether an absence is excused, I will not rehash lectures for students who miss class. You are responsible for gathering notes on missed classes.</p>

			<h3 id="procedures">BASICS OF CLASS PROCEDURES / A FEW RULES</h3>

			<p>After the day’s presentation/lecture and/or demonstration - you must work only on class projects during in-class work-time. If you finish a project early, add complexity. If you prefer to work on your own laptop, that is fine – bring it to class. After studio time has begun, quickly ready your materials and begin working as soon as possible. You may talk quietly to classmates during work time, but talking must not impede production. You must work hard the whole class period and you will be expected to work out of class also – our class meets for four hours a week so expect to work two to four hours outside of class. If you have a creative block, or if you don’t know what you want to produce, please talk to me.</p>

			<div id="line"></div>

			<p>NO CELL PHONES are to be used during class unless prior arrangements are made and if you receive an emergency call – please take it outside the classroom.</p>

			<div id="line"></div>

			<p>NO TEXT MESSAGING, INSTANT MESSAGING, CHECKING EMAIL OR SOCIAL MEDIA will be allowed during studio time.</p>

			<div id="line"></div>

			<p>Personal stereos (i.e. a MP3 players) and/or headphones are allowed in class ONLY while independently working and after I have given permission but you must be able to still hear me speak and when I address the class, pause the music and take off your headphones.</p>

			<div id="line"></div>
			
			<p>No food and drink are allowed in the labs. If caught, you will be expected to leave class and dispose of the items.</p>

			<p>Students are expected to participate in class. Inappropriate behavior such as reading non-course materials, checking email, instant or text messag- ing, studying for other classes or sleeping will result in dismissal from that day’s class and count as an unexcused absence.</p>

			<p>Students are accountable for turning in all work on time. Faculty will either penalize late assignments or refuse to accept them.</p>

			<p>Working in groups is part of all communications work. Students who fail to do their share of work on team projects or are unwilling to participate in group problem solving will be dismissed from the teams and lose credit for projects.</p>

			<p>Students are always welcome to seek more information about why they received a particular grade on a test or assignment, obtain guidance for how to improve work and ask for suggestions on solving problems. They are encouraged to go above and beyond the minimum work assigned and to demonstrate enthusiasm for work in their fields. In the JMC Department C work is minimal work. A and B work goes beyond the minimum.</p>

			<div id="line"></div>

			<h4 id="tech">Technology</h4>
			<p>Save your work every frequently, at least every 5 minutes – the more often, the better. Create at least one back-up disk of all your work as well as keeping files on a jump-drive (memory stick) or larger external hard drive to prevent permanent loss. Please remember things happen such as: computer freezes, Internet connections fail and files can become corrupt...just to name a few. So please do not wait until the last minute to upload or complete your assignment. You may also use online storage such as Dropbox in addition to the Server. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/External-Hard-Drives-Storage-Add-Ons/b?node=595048">external hard drive.</a></p> 

			<p>IMPORTANT: Losing computer files will not excuse you from completing assignments or handing them in on time. Please remember to back up your work.</p>
			
			<h4 id="tech">Homework</h4>
			<p>You will have homework every week, sometimes projects will double-up if there is a longer term project. There will sometimes be videos and reading to respond to as well as your projects. Projects are generally due for a grade one week from the date of the critique, which means you will have a week to turn in your homework for a grade after critique/feedback. All assignment details are found on Blueline under Assignments.</p>

			<h4 id="tech">How to turn in Digital Files</h4>
			<p>Most projects are due as digital files and you are responsible for uploading your projects as they are due (usually weekly). A couple projects are also due as prints that you will mount on mat or poster board. One project is a book you will have printed by a printer online. Grades are usually posted on Blueline within 2 weeks after “collecting” the works. In general, you will be evaluated on your consistency in working inside and outside of class, your participation in critiques, having your own projects ready on time, your contribution to your colleagues in the class during critiques, and your willingness to try new things (be ready to make interesting mistakes). Remember that attendance also impacts your grade: each absence over two (2) unexcused absences will reduce your grade by one letter.</p>

			<h4 id="tech">Critiques / Feedback</h4>
			<p>Except for the final project, we will critique your sketches directly from your sketchbooks. However, when you turn in your finals for the grade, you will need to scan them and create a multi-page pdf.</p>

			<p>You will participate in critiques a couple times in the semester. At times these will occur with the whole class providing feedback and at other times the class will be broken into smaller groups or you will be assigned a few classmates names and you will write responses, suggestions, etc and leave the feedback in text form in their digital box on the instructors computer or via blueline. The format and content of these critiques will change – varying from verbal to written responses, often answering specific instructor-provided questions. The small group responses will be followed up with the instructor or as a large group discussion. Critiques will get easier the more you do them. You must learn to accept feedback and also learn to defend your choices. Most critiques will consist of your professor giving feedback, sometimes the students will lead the critiques as the semester progresses on bigger projects.</p>

			<h4 id="tech">Blueline Classroom Component</h4>
			<p>I will be posting the syllabus as well as assignment details in our online classroom. I will not be printing the instructions, if you need one you may do so on your own. You will turn in all projects on Blueline (and also in print form if directed). Grades will also be posted on Blueline.</p>

			<h3>GRADES / ASSIGNMENTS / PROJECT EVALUATIONS</h3>
			<P>I will be collecting your exercises, assignments and projects as they are due and I will have your work returned and grades posted on Blueline usu- ally within 2 weeks after collecting the works. You will also be evaluated on your consistency in working inside and outside of class (so attendance is essential), your participation in critiques (having your own projects ready on time and your contribution to your colleagues in the class), and your willingness to try things (be ready to make interesting mistakes). Remember that attendance also impacts your grade: each unexcused absence over two unexcused absences will reduce your grade by one letter grade.</P> 

			<p>Except for the final project, we will critique your sketches directly from your sketchbooks. However, when you turn in your finals for the grade, you will need to scan them and create a multi-page pdf.</p>

			<p>Projects must be ready for critique. From that day, you will have one week to turn it in for a grade after you have implemented recommended changes from the critique.</p>

			<h4 id="tech">GRADING CRITERIA</h4>
			<p>Points can be earned in different categories via a rubric – some categories can impact grades more than others. It is very difficult to achieve “A” quality work in the class. An “A” project will be considered professional level design, and perfect in the majority of grading categories. B+ and B grades will be given to good work that is well above course expectations.</p>

			<p>Simply meeting the expectations of the course in completing assignments, quizzes, projects and the practical will result in a C grade. Doing the minimum amount of work to get by is not going to earn you a good grade. In order to earn grades higher than a C, I expect students to show sub- stantial growth in critical skills, mastery of the technical elements of the course, and perfect execution of design concepts in major projects. D and F work will fail to meet expectations.</p>

			<p>Being late for a critique (including not having your assignment prepared when class begins) will result in a 10% “late fee” on that grade the moment that critique starts, and through the first 24 hours after critique starts. Another 10% will be assessed in the second 24 hour period. Late assignments cannot be revised.</p>

			<p>Failure to turn in any assignment will result in a maximum course grade of D. I reserve the right to reject assignments after the second 24 hour period has expired, thus triggering the automatic maximum course grade of D.</p>

			<h4 id="tech">GRADING CATEGORIES</h4>
			<p>Each project will be graded according to how well the student fulfilled the objectives of the project. However, participation and personal growth are important factors in the evaluation. All assignments are graded by the criteria of the 6 categories listed below but additional categories or factors may be added. In-class projects, research, critiques, homework projects, and final projects are assigned different values. The 6 categories of grading will help you identify your strengths and weaknesses. By observing recurring patterns or problem areas, you can change your outcome. Each project will value the different categories by different percentages.</p>
