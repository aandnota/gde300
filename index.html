			<h3 id="summary">SUMMARY</h3>
			<p>Concept Sketch Development is designed to allow students to solve creative problems each week, but not necessarily take every idea to its final product. This course teaches quick and agile thinking.</p>

			<h3 id="descr" >DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>The objective of this course is to focus on concept development and creative problem solving, presenting ideas in sketch form rather than fully realized pieces/products. Each week new ideas will be presented to the group as if a client were looking for a designer to take on a particular project.</p>

			<p>Our work in this course will be accomplished through: demonstrations, in-class studio work, lectures, image and video presentations, one-on-one instruction, group discussions/critiques, online tutorials, research and out-of-class homework. Participation is crucial to achieve the learning objectives.</p>
		
			<p>Our work in this course will be accomplished through: demonstrations, in-class studio work, lectures, image and video presentations, one-on- one instruction, group discussions/critiques, online tutorials, research and out-of-class homework. Participation is crucial to achieve the learning objectives. It is equally crucial that you strive to maintain an open mind and make the most of each project. If you have had similar projects in the past â€“ it is your responsibility to add levels of complication to make each project challenging and rewarding. Please ask me for ideas if you want to add complexity to a project. If there is insufficient time in class, please arrange to work with me one-on-one during office hours.
			</p>

			<p>There is no textbook required for this course. For the purpose of discussion and for research, students will be required to read materials and watch tutorials given in class, via books provided in class, readings stored in the Blueline classroom, and via websites. We will have a test at Mid-term and a final project. I will routinely give online links and bring books and magazines to class for you to either read or browse for specific project research or general research on graphics, design and/or illustration trends. Written responses will be required to some readings, images, design and videos.

			<p>Attendance and punctuality are mandatory. This is more true in this class than possibly any of my other graphics classes. This is because the dialog that happens in class is one of the most important things we will be doing. At times we will address assignments as a group. At other times you will be working on your own. However, I expect students to be bouncing ideas off each other, as well as me, every class. Designers often work in an isolated world, but this is not always true. Designers are just as often dealing with clients and feedback from both clients and colleagues. We teach plenty of classes where students are working alone. This will be one of your chances to work creatively in a group and I will want you to do it as often as possible.</p>
			
			<p>Additionally, as with all our other classes, I expect you to behave as professionals over the course of the semester, and that includes showing up to class on time. Excused absences include athletic participation for varsity athletes, some emergencies, and documented illness. Regardless of wheth- er an absence is excused, I will not rehash lectures for students who miss class. You are responsible for gathering notes on missed classes.</p>
